Lucky Day adds the badge from Paper Mario fame into Terraria! 

Crafted directly from and a sidegrade (well, upgrade in 1.3) to the Brain of Confusion, it works similarly to its 1.4 counterpart but with no Confusion effect/critical strike chance -- however, the dodge effect has no cooldown. Custom visuals and sound effects on proc.

Crafted at a Tinkerer's Workshop | Recipe: Brain of Confusion
